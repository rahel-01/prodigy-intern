        <h3>Project 1</h3>
        <p>Speaker Recognition 
            • Developed a speaker recognition system using convolutional  neural network (CNN) to process 
            and analyze audio  signals. 
            • Our approach involved leveraging  the capabilities of CNNs to extract relevant features from audio 
            spectrograms , which proved to be effective in distinguishing between different speakers. 
            • Extract and process the audio files from the IEMOCAP dataset. Clean the audio data by removing 
            any noise and normalizing the volume levels</p>
